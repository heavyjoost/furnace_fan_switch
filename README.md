Little project that replaces part of the fan limit switch inside my furnace. This is a time-based solution and does not replace the temperature limit part of the original switch. When powered up a relay gets energized which bypasses the fan (not limit) switch. The datasheet/code is pretty simple and should explain how it works :)
